abstract = {Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) are among the most serious and catastrophic of acute cardiac disorders, accounting for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year worldwide. Although the incidence of AMI has been decreasing in the US according to the American Heart Association, heart disease is still the leading cause of mortality in adults. In most cases of AMI and in a majority of cases of SCD, the underlying pathology is acute intraluminal coronary thrombus formation within an epicardial coronary artery leading to total or near-total acute coronary occlusion. This article summarizes our current understanding of the pathophysiology of these acute coronary syndromes and briefly discusses new approaches currently being researched in an attempt to define and ultimately reduce their incidence.},

@article{Castiglioni2007,
abstract = {Seismocardiogram (SCG) is the recording of body vibrations induced by the heart beat. SCG contains information on cardiac mechanics, in particular heart sounds and cardiac output. In this paper we present a new wearable device for SCG recordings during long term monitorings, and the results of a validation test in 4 subjects. The system is based on the integration of the MagIC smart shirt (i.e., a textile-based wearable system for the assessment of ECG and respiratory movements), and an external triaxial MEMS accelerometer positioned on the left clavicle. SCG was estimated as the average of accelerations occurred in each heart beat. The SCG components due to the valve closure and to recoil forces following the heart contraction (ballistocardiogram) were extracted by high-pass (>18 Hz) and band-pass (0.6-20 Hz) filters respectively. Then the difference between the I and J waves of the ballistocardiogram (|I-J| index, possibly related to the cardiac output) was identified by an ad-hoc procedure and compared with the model flow indirect estimation of cardiac output. Validation on 4 volunteers showed that: 1) our wearable system provides statistically consistent estimates of both heart-sound related vibrations and recoil movements; 2) reliable estimates of the |I-J| index can be obtained by considering about 1 minute of SCG recording in stationary conditions; and 3) changes of the |I-J| index during exercise correlate well with changes of cardiac output estimated by the model flow.},

abstract = {A large proportion of cardiovascular events occur in individuals classified by traditional risk factors as "low-risk." Efforts to improve early detection of coronary artery disease among low-risk individuals, or to improve risk assessment, might be justified by this large population burden. The most promising tests for improving risk assessment, or early detection, include the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Data regarding the role of additional testing in low-risk populations to improve early detection or to enhance risk assessment are sparse but suggest that CAC and ABI may be helpful for improving risk classification and detecting the higher-risk people from among those at lower risk. However, in the absence of clinical trials in this patient population, such as has recently been proposed, we do not recommend routine use of any additional testing or screening in low-risk individuals at this time.},

abstract = {We conducted a systematic review of the literature for assessing the value of home monitoring for heart failure (HF) patients. The abstracts of 383 articles were read. We excluded those in which either no home monitoring was done or only the technical aspects of the telemedicine application were described. Forty-two studies met the selection criteria. We classified the results into feasibility (technical and institutional) and impact (on the clinical process, on patient health, on accessibility and acceptability of the health system, and on the economy). Evaluating the articles showed that home monitoring in HF patients is viable, given that: (1) it appears to be technically effective for following the patient remotely; (2) it appears to be easy to use, and it is widely accepted by patients and health professionals; and (3) it appears to be economically viable. Furthermore, home monitoring of HF patients has been shown to have a positive impact on: (1) the clinical process, supported by a significant improvement of patient follow-up by adjustment of treatment, diet or behaviour, as well as hospital readmissions and emergency visits reduction; (2) the patient's health, supported by a relevant improvement in quality of life, a reduction of days in hospital, and a decrease in mortality; and (3) costs resulting from the use of health resources.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Home blood pressure monitoring is the self-measurement of blood pressure by patients. In the diagnosis and management of high blood pressure it is complementary to 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and clinic blood pressure measurements. Home monitoring can also help to identify white-coat and masked hypertension. Home monitoring has good reproducibility, is well tolerated and relatively inexpensive. It is superior to blood pressure taken in the clinic in predicting cardiovascular events and mortality. Twice-daily measurements are recommended, usually in the morning and evening for a minimum of five days. The threshold for defining hypertension is an average home blood pressure of 135/85 mmHg or above. Patients are engaged with their management when they monitor their own blood pressure. This results in increased adherence to therapy and lower blood pressure. predict hypertensive end-organ disease, 9-12 and are stronger predictors for cardiovascular events and mortality. 13-16 Several international guidelines recommend using home blood pressure monitoring for hypertension diagnosis, evaluation of suspected white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension, and for guiding management.},

abstract = {Today, a rather comprehensive view of the state of the cardiovascular system can be obtained in the clinical environment. The already established methods, such as electrocardiography, phonocardiography, and impedance cardiography, are relatively inexpensive methods and produce information about the electrical phenomena, sound waves, and impedance variations produced by the function of the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, and X-ray computed tomography, on the otherhand, are relatively expensive and labor-intensive methods that produce images of the cardiovascular system and provide information about the perfusion and metabolism of themyocardium and also the blood flow. Seismocardiography (SCG) is a newly revived inexpensive method where local vibrations due to cardiovascular function are detected non-invasively from the sternum. These vibrations provide information about the mechanical function of the cardiovascular system that can be used as an independent diagnostic cue or as a complement to the contemporary methods. Thusfar, SCG has been proposed to be a useful tool in ischemia detection. SCG is also proposed to function as a relatively simple method for assessing myocardial contractility. While the bulkiness of the sensors and limited computing capacity hindered the feasibility of SCG in the clinical environment, the advances in computing power and accelerometer technology have now enabled practical SCG implementations. In this thesis, the feasibility of SCG and the means to successfully implement a practical system for detection of SCG signals were studied. Two different SCG measurement systems were implemented and their performance was evaluated. The present implementations featured improved acceleration measurement sensitivity and a multimodal approach to the detection of SCG and auxiliary physiological signals. Also, the three-dimensional aspect of the SCG signals was more extensively utilized than in previous works. These enhancements improved SCG measurements and will increase the potential of SCG to be taken into clinical practice.},

abstract = {In this research work, systolic time intervals and stroke volume were extracted through the processing of recorded mechanical cardiac vibrations from the sternum, seismocardiogram (SCG). These hemodynamic parameters were extracted based on the physiological characterization of SCG with different modalities including echocardiography, ballistocardiography, Doppler ultrasound, and finite element modelling. For the first time, an extensive evaluation of the SCG estimation of systolic time intervals compared to those from Doppler ultrasound and impedance cardiogram was performed (n=25). It was shown that SCG can estimate pre-ejection period (p-value=0.16), left ventricular ejection time (p-value=0.93), and QS2 (p-value=0.91). In a novel approach, the effects of respiration on SCG was studied on 45 participants. As the results of this study it was found that there is a difference between SCG cycles during inspiration and the ones during expiration (p- value<0.01). It was also shown that expiration cycles are more similar to each other compared to inspiration cycles. Based on this finding, a new averaging algorithm for SCG was proposed based on the consideration of the respiration effect on SCG. The previously defined IC point, isotonic contraction, on SCG was redefined to correspond to the point of maximum acceleration of blood in the aorta. This finding was confirmed using Doppler ultrasound (n=23, r=0.85) and ultra low frequency ballistocardiography (n=5, p-value=0.95).},

abstract = {A multicenter study was performed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of a new technique, Seismocardiography, with that of electrocardiography for physiologically and anatomically significant ischemic coronary artery disease (CAD) during exercise stress testing. Five participating centers enrolled 129 patients who had simultaneous seismocardiograms and 12-lead electrocardiograms at the time of their exercise treadmill stress tests. Two different definitions of CAD were used: anatomic and physiologically significant disease. The presence of anatomically significant CAD (???50{\%} diameter stenosis) was documented by coronary angiography. Physiologically significant CAD was defined as present in the same 129 patients when coronary arteriography (???50{\%} diameter stenosis) and thallium-201 scintigraphy (defect on initial postexercise images) were both abnormal. Seismocardiography had a significantly better sensitivity for detecting anatomic CAD than did electrocardiography (73 vs 48{\%}; p < 0.001), without loss of specificity (78 vs 80{\%}; p = NS). Exercise seismocardiography added significant incremental diagnostic information beyond that provided by exercise electrocardiography. Seismocardiography was more sensitive (without less specificity) in women and in patients who did not achieve maximal predicted heart rate. In patients with physiologically significant CAD, the seismocardiogram was also significantly more sensitive (78{\%}) than was the electrocardiogram (55{\%}) (p < 0.02), without loss of specificity (84 vs 74{\%}). Seismocardiography significantly improved sensitivity for the detection of anatomic and physiologic CAD. It is easy to perform and may be a clinically useful adjunct in exercise stress testing. ?? 1993.},
